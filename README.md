# 📝 MERN Todo App

A clean and responsive **Todo App** built using the **MERN stack** — MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This app allows users to manage their daily tasks with options to add, edit, complete, and delete todos. It features a modern UI built with Tailwind CSS and is fully deployed on Render.

4. Long tasks are gracefully truncated to maintain layout.
5. Tasks are stored in a cloud database (MongoDB).

- Hosted on **Render** with auto-deploy from GitHub.
- Backend API routes exposed under `/api/todos`.
- Frontend handles proxying in development and static serving in production.
